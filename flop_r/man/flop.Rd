\title{Run the FLOP causal discovery algorithm.}
\usage{
flop(data, lambdaBic, restarts = NA, timeout = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data matrix with rows corresponding to observations and columns to variables/nodes.}

\item{lambdaBic}{The penalty parameter of the BIC, a typical value for structure learning is 2.0.}

\item{restarts}{Optional parameter specifying the number of ILS restarts. Either restarts or timeout (below) need to be specified.}

\item{timeout}{Optional parameter specifying a timeout after which the search returns. At least one local search is run up to a local optimum. Either restarts or timeout need to be specified.}
}
\value{
A matrix encoding a CPDAG. The entry in row i and column j is 1 in case of a directed edge from i to j and 2 in case of an undirected edge between those nodes (in case of an undirected edge, the entry in row j and column i is also 2, that is each undirected edge induce two 2's in the matrix).
}
\description{
For the given data and parameters, the FLOP algorithm is run and returns the learned graph as an adjacency matrix.

\examples{
p <- 10
W <- matrix(0, nrow = p, ncol = p)
W[cbind(1:(p-1), 2:p)] <- 1
X <- matrix(rnorm(10000 * p), nrow = 10000, ncol = p) \%*\% solve(diag(p) - W)
X_std <- scale(X)
flop(X, 2.0, restarts=50)
